# **The Hangman Game**
## **Overview**

Hangman is a word guessing game. its considered as one of the classic game where a player will try to figure out the word by guessing letters by entering one at a time. This is an online game and it's for educational or entertainment purpose.

Basic Rule is that a user will be displayed with the blank spaces (underscores) to guess the word. Based on number of underscores user can guess a letter for each trails. There will be 6 trails. If the guessed letter is in the word, then it replaces the corresponding underscore with a guessed letter. For each incorrect guess, a body part (head, arms, torso and legs) is added. After of 6 guesses the game ends in a loss for the guessers.

Winning and losing of the game will depend on the user guessing all the letters in the word before the no of wrong guesses trails are over.
Win: The game is won if the player guesses all the letters in the word before the hangman figure is fully drawn.
Loss: The game is lost if the guesser runs out of chances (i.e., if the hangman is fully drawn and the word remains incomplete).

The game is Python-based and uses class, functions, for loops, while loops and if/elif/else statements to achieve the desired outcome. It features space-based ASCII art, and contains various references to hangman characters.

#### **Lucid Chart:**

Project planning has been done with the Lucid Chart[LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com).


This proved to be very useful tool when it came to visualising the various processes involved in recreating a Battleships style game. Whilst the concept is quite simple, the logic involved proved slightly more difficult.

This is the flow chart which assisted the development of the game:

## **Features**

#### **Menu**

* The game uses a Board class. It is used to create instances of the player and CPU and guess boards. Only the player and player_guess boards are printed to the terminal through the display_boards method. The class stores the board size, board owner and shield strength. There are methods to input ship coordinates, populate the board, logic for CPU guesses. There are also methods to check and validate user input as well as prevent any ships overlapping.
‚Äã
#### **Instructions** 

![Screenshot of start screen](assets/images/bs77-start-screen.png)

* The start screen features the iconic Star Wars introduction: "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..." Beneath that is some very basic ASCII art depicting stars. There a short time delay using the time.sleep() function to allow the user to process the screen. They are then prompted to press enter.

![Screenshot of player name input](assets/images/bs77-name-input.png)

* The os.sys("clear") function is used to clear the screen and the user is then presented with ASCII text intended to emulate the Star Wars movie font. They are prompted to enter their name using the get_name function which stores the username in a variable for use in the game. They are then presented with a short welcome message and short backstory explaining enemy ships have entered the area. The user can press enter to proceed to the next screen.

#### **Play Game Section**

![Screenshot of ship types](assets/images/bs77-ship-types.png)

* The same os function is used to clear the terminal once again. The ship_type method is called so the user is presented with the four different types of ships at their disposal, along with the size of each. The ships are displayed sequentially in descending size order, on a slight delay using the time library.

![Screenshot of legend](assets/images/bs77-legend.png)

* Upon pressing enter, the game_rules function is called to display the symbols which will be used on the game boards. Once the user has processed the information, they are prompted to press enter again.

* The following text explains the win condition which states that ten hits will be enough to win the game. There is a final prompt to press enter.

![Screenshot of win condition](assets/images/bs77-win-condition.png)


![Screenshot of player board and prompt to enter ship direction](assets/images/bs77-choose-direction.png)

* os is used to clear the screen once again and the player board is printed to the terminal. It displays the player name and the shield strength at the starting value of 10. The place_ships method is called so the player is asked to place each ship by choosing whether it will be aligned horizontally or vertically. Any input other than 'h'/'H' or 'v'/'V' will be invalid and the user will be asked to try again. The process will loop until all ships have been assigned coordinates.

#### **Exit Section**

![Screenshot of player hitting ship](assets/images/bs77-hit-ship.png)

* The populate_boards method adds the user and CPU ships to their respective boards. The user cannot see where the CPU ships are. The game is set up so the user goes first. The player_attack method takes input from the user to guess enemy ship coordinates on the x and y axes. The first CPU guess is a random choice on the board. Upon a successful hit, the CPU will attempt to guess on an adjacent tile. Click the highlighted text to see screenshots of the player entering invalid [row](assets/images/bs77-invalid-row.png) or [column](assets/images/bs77-invalid-column.png) coordinates. The user cannot enter the same coordinates twice. Most of the game logic is in the play_game function which handles updating and appending the relevant boards. It also handles decrementing the shield counter. The game will continue to run until either the player or CPU shield counters reaches zero.

## **Future-Enhancements**
‚Äã
There can be many areas where the game can be enhanced. But due to project tight deadline and due to the challenges the scope was limited
Further enhancements can be as follows.
‚Äã
* Adding a timer while guessing a letter.
* Introduce different categories. (Currently only flower names/words are guessed.)
* Option to randlomly quitting the game in between.
* An hint system to get a user about the word

‚Äã
## **Testing Phase**
‚Äã
**Functionality**

* Implementation üè≠: Check whether user is able to play game from start to finish
* Test üß™: Played the game locally many times.
* Result üèÜ: The game worked as expected
* Verdict ‚úÖ: PASS

<br>

**Validators**

* The PEP8 Online Validator was down when creating this project, however I added a PEP8 validator to my workspace by running the command: "pip3 install pycodestyle". The results can be found [here](assets/images/bs1977-pycodestyle.png)

* The validator flags a number of minor warnings, all of which are related to the use of the ASCII art used in the start screen, win screen and lose screen functions. In my final mentor session, I was informed these are inconsequential and can essentially be ignored as they do not affect the program itself.

‚Äã
‚Äã
## **Bugs**
‚Äã
Some of the bugs were identified during testing. They are listed below.

* üêû - Initially the ascii charcater for hangmans head was towards left and were not in align with hands and legs. 
* ‚öíÔ∏è - Didnt checkj properly the alingmments of the ascii characters which makes the hangman.
* ‚úÖ - Added a space towards left of the ascii character which makes the head.

<br>

* üêû - When the duplicate characters are entered, there was no validation.
* ‚öíÔ∏è - Since validating duplicate entries of the character was missing.
* ‚úÖ - Added a new method to validate the duplicate entries.

‚Äã<br>

* üêû - User could enter special characters, digits or anything 
* ‚öíÔ∏è - The implementation for valid characters was not in the place.
* ‚úÖ - Implemented the valid character checking, if invalid character is enetred error is thrown to the user.

<br>

* üêû - Menu list was wrongly ordered
* ‚öíÔ∏è - 
* ‚úÖ - I

## **Credits**

* A youtube tutorial which helped me to understand and build logic for hangman game was really great.
[Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag8NtD1e0Kc). Based on this tutorial, I have used the logic to build the game. Then later it is enhanced with mentors guidance and suggestions.

* Another youtube tutorial related to hangman game was very helpful initially to understand on how to play the game. The course is by [Triple S Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGOeiQfjYPk) 

* Course material in Scrimba was also very helpful for me to understand python in a short time. [Scrimba-Python](https://scrimba.com/learn-python-c03/~00)

* I have also used Chat-GPT to understand the Hangman game and its features. [Chat-GPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
